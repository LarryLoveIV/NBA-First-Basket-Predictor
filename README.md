# NBA-First-Basket-Predictor
## UNDER CONSTRUCTION
### This is a project to predict which player will score the first basket in an NBA game.

## First, we build a model to predict the winner of the jump ball
## Then, we will build a model that works in tandem with the jump ball winner model and predicts the first basket scorer given the jump ball winner and the opponent
